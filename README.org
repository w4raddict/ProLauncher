  - [ ] Proper Stop()
- [X] Left panel for accounts
- [ ] Upon close: End all BSGO client processes (as eventhandler in mainwindowviewmodel)
- [ ] *Console mode*: including old launcher UI (implementation via executable .bat and .sh file, same window would be good).
- [X] Left panel: Loaded accounts. Middle: 'Active Account'
- [ ] Save Login Data button upon login (if not checked, acc is added to mv.AccList but not saved onto desk, and disappears if acc is logged out or another loaded)
- [X] ~killall aplay~ on exit
- [ ] Testing on Windows, Mac, Linux [0/3]
  - [ ] WINE only on Mac, Linux

** TODO Debug [0/5]
