- [ ] Proper music player [0/2]
  - [ ] Proper Mute (that doesn't fuck up my OS)
  - [ ] Proper Stop()
- [X] Left panel for accounts
- [ ] Upon close: End all BSGO client processes (as eventhandler in mainwindowviewmodel)
- [ ] *Console mode*: including old launcher UI (implementation via executable .bat and .sh file, same window would be good).
- [X] Left panel: Loaded accounts. Middle: 'Active Account'
- [ ] Save Login Data button upon login (if not checked, acc is added to mv.AccList but not saved onto desk, and disappears if acc is logged out or another loaded)
- [X] ~killall aplay~ on exit
- [ ] Testing on Windows, Mac, Linux [0/3]
  - [ ] WINE only on Mac, Linux
  - [ ] Check if WINE is installed
  - [ ] Information box: You must configure WINE and your GPU drivers, yourself!
** Project refactoring [0/1]
- [ ] Manage mv.CurrentAcc properly
  
** Left panel properties [2/4]
- [X] Loads all accounts from the ~/.bsgoLauncher/Accounts/Accounts.json path
- [ ] All logged-in accounts added automatically (if 'Save Login Data' is checked)
- [X] Scrolling ability if too many accounts
- [-] Per account: [1/5]
  - [X] +Load (make active, -> icon)+ (unnecessary)

** Central Panel Properties [0/2]
- [ ] Shows 'Save this account' in login/register formula, otherwise it throws acc away.
** TODO Debug [0/5]
- [ ] Print Errors to console as well. (rather than 'just' errorbox)
- [ ] Remove old functions
- [ ] Cookie validate stuff: Wrapper around Play! If Play() fails, do Login() and call Play() again. Only then throw error message.

- [ ] Option to hide usernames for anonymization (cool anonymous icon in settings)
- [ ] Account faction displayed as well, with Switch Faction button

* Configuration
** Windows
If you're using Windows and you have problems running BSGO, go ask your grandma. I bet she knows more about computers than you do.
** MacOS
If you're using an ARM Mac, BSGO might not run properly.

Make sure you have WINE installed. Recommendation: Install it through Homebrew.

#+begin_src shell
  brew install --cask wine
  # A beautiful front-end for WINE.
  brew install winetricks
#+end_src

** Linux
*** A complete WINE installation
As BSGO was developed for Windows, it requires an installation of WINE to run on your Linux machine.

On Ubuntu-based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop_OS, ElementaryOS, KDE Neon), paste this into your terminal:

#+begin_src 
# WINE
sudo apt install winetricks
sudo apt install winbind
# 32 bit support
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
# equivalent of lib32-gnutils
sudo apt-get install gnutls-bi
# for wine-mono build
sudo apt install libgdiplus
sudo apt install dos2unix

#+end_src

On most machines, this is enough to get BSGO running on Linux.

If the launcher finds a WINE installation on your computer [fn:1], it runs BSGO using WINE. Otherwise, you will receive an error message.

*** Error: WINE doesn't know which drivers to load
If you encounter problems with BSGO, it may be because WINE can't decide which drivers to load.

If your Linux distribution supports GPU configuration, make sure to choose the most powerful GPU you have (usually the dedicated GPU if you have one), and reboot your system. *Avoid hybrid graphics mode*, as it might lead to problems.

Also, make sure you have 32-bit architecture enabled, as it is disabled on most modern Linux systems by default. BSGO won't run without this option.

If you're using an Ubuntu-based distribution, the following code might help you. Otherwise, find equivalent commands and packages for your Linux distribution.

Paste the code into the terminal and reboot your system:

#+begin_src shell
  # The following is for Ubuntu-based Linux distributions with an nvidia GPU using proprietary Nvidia drivers.

  # Enable 32-bit support (required for BSGO)
  sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386

  # download proprietary nvidia drivers
  sudo apt install nvidia-driver-430:i386 libnvidia-gl-430:i386 xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-430:i386 libnvidia-cfg1-430:i386 libnvidia-ifr1-430:i386 libnvidia-decode-430:i386 libnvidia-encode-430:i386 nvidia-settings
  sudo apt install nvidia-driver-430 libnvidia-gl-430 nvidia-utils-430 xserver-xorg-video-nvidia-430 libnvidia-cfg1-430 libnvidia-ifr1-430 libnvidia-decode-430 libnvidia-encode-430 nvidia-settings

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Make sure 'wine' is in your $PATH. You don't have to worry about that if you install WINE as shown above.
